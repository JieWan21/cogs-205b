%% Monte Carlo integration
% Probably the most common numerical integration technique in our area is a
% little bit strange.  It turns out that often you can approximate
% integrals by using random number generation.  
%%
% Let's return to the curve we started with: $y = e^{-x^2}$.  For this
% method, we are going to draw a box around the curve, completely capturing
% in.  The box we'll call the *envelope* and since it is rectangular, the
% area is easy to calculate.  Then we are going to randomly select points
% inside the envelope and count how often they are under the curve.  Since
% the probability of being under the curve must be proportional to the area
% under the curve, we can now calculate what the area under the curve is,
% relative to the area of the envelope.  An example!

%% Monte Carlo Example
% Make an anonymous function for the curve and plot it
fcn = @(x) exp(-x.^2);

xax = linspace(-5, 5, 101);

plot(xax, fcn(xax), 'linewidth', 2)

%% Define the envelope
width  = 10;
height =  1;
e_area = (width * height);

%% Generate a bunch of random points in the envelope
N    = 1e6;

rx = ( rand(N, 1) - 0.5 )  *  width;
ry = ( rand(N, 1)       )  *  height;

%% Count which points are in the area of interest
in = ry < fcn(rx);

M = mean(in) * e_area

%% Display the points in the figure
lops = {'marker', '.', 'linestyle', 'none'};
line(rx(~in), ry(~in), 'color', 'g', lops{:})
line(rx( in), ry( in), 'color', 'r', lops{:})


%% Back to the expected value
% In many of the same cases as Gaussian quadrature, we can use a Monte
% Carlo method to approximate an integral, by randomly sampling from the
% factored distribution and computing the function on those samples:
%%
% $$E(f(x)) = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}f(x)p(x)dx$$
%%
% $$E(f(x)) \approx \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=0}^n f(x_k) \quad \mbox{with} \quad x_k \sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)$
%%
% Let's see this at work for $f(x) = x^4$:

fcn = @(x) x.^4 ;

%%
% Let's also set the parameters of the $x$ distribution:
mu = 1;
si = 1;

N = 1e6;

x = randn(N,1)*si+mu;
mean(fcn(x))

%% Y tho?
% These Monte Carlo methods clearly take so much more computing power.  Why
% do we use them?  The answer is simple.  MC methods are easy to implement
% and widely applicable.  You don't have to think about them too much.
